    UNIX is based on discrete events that don't have to happen at a precise moment in time. The human organism, meanwhile, is based on continous sensory, cognitive, and motor processes that have to be synchronized precisely in time.  UNIX expresses too large a belief in discrete abstract symbols and not enough of a belief in temporal, continuous, non-abstract reality; it is more like a typewriter than a dance partner. (Perhaps typerwriters or word processors ought to always be instantly responsive, like a dance partner -- but that is not yet the case.) UNIX tends to "want" to connect to reality as if reality were a network of fast typists. The arguments in favour of UNIX focused on how computers would get literally millions of times faster in the coming decades. The thinking was that the speed increase would overwhelm the timing problems I was worried about. Indeed, today's computers are literally millions of times faster, and UNIX has become an ambient part of life. There are some reasonably expressive tools that have UNIX in them, so the speed increase has sufficed to compensate for UNIX's problems in some cases. But not all.  I have an iPhone in my pocket, and sure enough, the thing has what is essentially UNIX in it. An unnerving element of this gadget is that it is haunted by a wierd set of unpredictable user interface delays. One's mind waits for the response to the press of a virtual button, but it doesn't come for a while. An odd tension builds during that moment, and easy intuition is replaced by nervousness. It is the ghost of UNIX, still refusing to accomodate the rhythms of my body and my mind, after all these years.
